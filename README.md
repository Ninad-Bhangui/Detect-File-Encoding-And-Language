# Detect-File-Encoding-and-Language
An NPM package that detects the encoding and language of a file.

* Detects 37? languages and their encoding
* Works best with large input files
* Completely free, no API key required

For reliable encoding and language detection inputs of 500 words or more are recommended. Smaller inputs can work as well but the results will be less accurate and in some cases incorrect.
